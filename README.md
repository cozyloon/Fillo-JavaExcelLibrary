# Fillo-JavaExcelLibrary

## Fillo API
Fillo API is a Java-based API designed to fetch data from Excel files. It is an open-source API created by Codoid. One of its major advantages is that it facilitates reading Excel data using Fillo API in Selenium. Fillo API allows users to perform select, insert, and update operations with where conditions and supports multiple where conditions for data retrieval and manipulation. This makes it very convenient for data-driven automated scripts. 

## Why Fillo API?
Fillo API has a number of advantages over other APIs like Jxl API and Apache POI. These APIs require a lot of code to traverse rows and columns and fetch values stored in an Excel sheet. Fillo API, however, takes care of all this internally, so there is no need to worry about the size of rows and columns. Fillo API supports CRUD operations with SQL queries, while Apache POI requires a lot of Java programming code for the same.

## Advantage of using Fillo API
- Erase the excel values ​​through script instead of manually.
- Add the data in particular row and column in excel sheet through script.
- Update any particular row and column data through Fillo API.
